##Day 9 Log – July 3, 2025

# Tasks Completed
- Finalized full Key To Note mechanic blueprint flow (screenshots: KeyToNote_1.png, KeyToNote_2.png, KeyToNote_3.png, KeyToNote_4.png, KeyToNote_5.png).
- Configured transition logic from speed-based progression to pulsating progression once 80% threshold is reached.
- Developed system to accumulate time while typing remains in correct tempo range using a .2s tick loop.
- Created win condition logic: 5s of correct tempo → triggers win.
- Organized blueprint with labeled regions: "Speed Calculations", "Correct Speed Progression", "Pulsating Progression", "Win Condition", and "Reset if Idle".
- Tuned Timeline curve for pulsating visual feedback with proper ease in/out points.
- Cleaned up logic with Gate node ensuring timeline plays once and resets properly without unintended loops.

# Issues Fixed
- Solved gate loop condition that was not re-opening under continuous input (key pressed repeatedly).
- Rewired logic to support Typing Speed Good flag triggering progression only when transitioning into pulsating state.
- Adjusted boolean guards and Gate node usage to ensure PulsatingProgress timeline is not retriggered unnecessarily on every keypress.

# Next Steps
- Add UI indicator to track pulsating time accumulated (e.g. radial bar, text counter).
- Trigger animation or level transition on win (can tie into existing sequence logic).
- Investigate jitter in needle visualization and smooth its movement.
- Begin testing fail conditions (e.g. timeout or wrong speed) and reset behavior polish.
