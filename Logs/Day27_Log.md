## Day 27 Log – July 30, 2025

# Tasks Completed
- Death System Implementation:
  - Added ragdoll death using physics simulation triggered on high Z-velocity impact.
  - Configured impulse (Z = 1500) for realistic collapse effect.
  - Added 3-second delay before returning to main menu.
- Physics Asset Review:
  - Verified SK_Survival_Character Physics Asset and enabled physics for ragdoll simulation.
- Bridge Sequence Polish:
  - Synchronized light flicker timing with camera movement for more dynamic visual rhythm.
  - Added subtle environmental fog for depth during bridge shots.

# Issues Encountered
- Physics asset tweaks required for ragdoll stability (prevented limb jitter on impact).
- Initial Sequencer interruption when returning to menu after death — added safe delay to resolve.

# Next Steps
- Refine bridge cinematic transitions and integrate traffic simulation.
- Finalize survival character animations for cinematic preview.
