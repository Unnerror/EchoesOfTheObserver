# Day 4 Log – June 26, 2025

## Tasks Completed
- Finalized UI logic to detect “good tempo” range (0.4–0.6 keys/sec) using In Range (Float) node.
- Created CheckTypingSpeedRange() function returning TypingSpeedGood boolean.
- Set up Blueprint: if speed enters range → play ProgressTimeline to animate radial fill; if speed exits → reverse/stop timeline.
- Implemented Material logic: used scalar ProgressBar parameter combined with Lerp and custom UV scaling to grow green overlay texture layer.
- Tied TypingSpeed value to both needle rotation and material parameter SpeedRange for dynamic feedback.
- Added fade-out Timeline (FadeOutTypingSpeed) to smoothly zero-out needle when typing stops.
- Bound all logic into Event Tick and Any Key flow to update UI in real time (demo: TypingSpeedometer_ProgressionIndicator.mp4).

## Issues Fixed
- Fixed texture scaling pivot by centering UVs manually.
- Swapped rotation direction by inverting scalar input to CustomRotator.
- Ensured rapid typing doesn’t prematurely clear the timestamp array—now resets only after defined pause.
- Integrated progress fill material update without interfering with needle movement.

## Next Steps
- Fine‑tune Timeline speeds: adjust ProgressTimeline curve for smoother fill animation over ~10 sec.
- Add smooth interpolation between updates to avoid UI jitter (consider lerping TypingSpeed).
- Playtest tempo range: ensure the 0.4–0.6 threshold is reasonable and tweak UI colors for clarity.
- Add event dispatchers on good tempo enter/exit for future gameplay hooks.
- Clean up Blueprint graph: modularize logic into functions/macros and add comments.
