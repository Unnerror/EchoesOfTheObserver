# Day 3 Log â€“ June 25, 2025

## Tasks Completed
- Imported UI assets: dial, needle, and radial fill images.
- Created Typing Speedometer material with CustomRotator to handle needle rotation.
- Set material domain to "User Interface" with translucent blending.
- Initialized Speedometer UI Blueprint and connected material as part of widget hierarchy.
- Ongoing: Needle rotation stretches outside the dial at non-right angles - debugging pivot and texture padding.

## Next Steps:
-Fix needle distortion by adjusting UVs or adding transparent padding to the texture.
-Set up radial progress overlay logic (based on correct typing tempo).
-Add logic to toggle active/inactive state with color change.
-Bind SpeedRange parameter to gameplay data.
