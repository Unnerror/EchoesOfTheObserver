## Day 29 Log – August 1, 2025

# Tasks Completed
- Cinematic Visual Polish:
  - Refined traffic generator timing for more natural vehicle flow.
  - Enhanced lighting setup on StJaque2 bridge and BioSphere sequences, adding subtle color grading for better atmosphere.
  - Adjusted Niagara fog density and fade timing for smoother cinematic transitions.
- Game Loop Testing:
  - Verified full game loop from Main Menu → StJaque2 master sequence → Mission 1 handoff.
  - Validated character spawn position, camera alignment, and input restoration in Mission 1.
- Performance Optimization:
  - Preloaded key cinematic assets to reduce frame hitches during level transitions.
  - Tuned fog particle bounds for more efficient rendering in cinematic shots.

# Issues Encountered
- Occasional delay in fog parameter updates when replaying the master sequence.
- Minor stutter detected during transition from BioSphere cinematic to Mission 1 gameplay, likely related to level switching.

# Next Steps
- Investigate Sequencer parameter persistence for Niagara fog opacity.
- Start implementing early UI feedback for Mission 1 (interaction prompts and objective indicators).
- Prepare first stable gameplay build for review with updated cinematics and transitions.
