## Day 12 Log – July 8, 2025

# Tasks Completed
- Connected OnKeyTypingWin event from the Key-to-Note mechanic to trigger the Memory Scene Level Sequence.
- Implemented listener for this event inside the Level Blueprint using Get All Actors of Class → Bind Event (Media/EventDispatcher.png, Media/BindingInLevelBP.png)
- Verified that triggering works in runtime.
- Added a placeholder Level Sequence for the Memory Scene and connected it to the mechanic completion.
- Cleaned up blueprint logic for scene transitions following the space typing mechanic.

# Issues Encountered
- Slight confusion with event binding from ThirdPersonCharacter to Level Blueprint — resolved by using dynamic multicast and binding at BeginPlay.
- Final visuals for the memory scene are still pending.
- Placeholder only; no interaction logic or cinematic animations in the memory scene yet.

# Next Steps
- Design and implement the full Memory Scene content (cinematic + visuals).
- After Memory Scene: prototype spaceship control mechanic.
- Begin integrating fog volumes and camera logic for seamless Earth-to-space visual transition.
- Replace Key-to-Note placeholder typing logic with full keyboard support and refined feedback.
