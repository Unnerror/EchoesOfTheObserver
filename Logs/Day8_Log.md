## Day 8 Log – July 2, 2025

# Tasks Completed
- Investigated and resolved persistent Sequencer rewind issue after sequence end.
- Identified that Finish Completion State must be set per animation track, not just in the Sequence Actor or Blueprint.
- Located the On Finished → Keep State option via right-click on the animation track > Properties > When Finished.
- Verified that the platform now correctly stays at final transform after Sequence ends (no longer jumps back; demo: Media/Platform.mp4).
- Added debug prints and timeline testing to confirm correct state persistence in-game.

# Issues Fixed
- Fixed unintended rewind to pre-animation transform despite setting Force Keep State globally - root cause was the per-track property not being set.
- Clarified the difference between the global "Restore Pre-Animated State" hotkey vs per-track finish behavior.

# Next Steps
- Link GoUpToSpace Sequence completion event to trigger Level Streaming or teleportation to space platform.
- Polish animation smoothing and timing at 330.
- Add sound or camera shake cue during ascension for feedback.
- Begin work on MetaSounds integration and KeyToNote interaction on space platform.
- Continue blocking out sky environment and backdrop for space-level immersion.
