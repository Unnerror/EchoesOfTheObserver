## Day 7 Log – July 1, 2025

# Tasks Completed
- Migrated the entire Hillside sample project into the EchoesOfObservers project (migrated part-by-part to avoid crashes).
- Verified and retained all levels and assets from the Hillside exterior while preserving original project files.
- Added the "space platform" destination area high above the main map (target for platform ascension).
- Placed a Trigger Box on the space platform to handle future KeyToNote interaction.

# Issues Fixed
- Resolved migration errors related to missing assets by identifying that the Sun Position Calculator plugin must be enabled in the destination project to support SunSky_C actors.
- Avoided overwriting essential project files during migration by skipping duplicates.

# Next Steps
- Enable and configure Sun Position Calculator plugin in EchoesOfObservers to fully support lighting assets from Hillside.
- Add Level Streaming logic or Level Instance for smooth transition from ground to space section after Sequence 2.
- Start prototyping KeyToNote logic:
  - Implement transition from player control to musical mode.
  - Begin MetaSounds integration for musical input feedback.
- Add lighting and atmosphere setup for the space segment.
- Begin placing dialogue triggers and placeholder UI prompts in the space level.
