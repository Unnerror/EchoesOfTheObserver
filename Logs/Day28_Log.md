## Day 28 Log – July 31, 2025

# Tasks Completed
- Game Loop Implementation:
  - Main Menu → Play → StJaque2 level loads and plays master sequence.
- Master sequence includes:
  - Bridge flythrough with traffic generator and custom lights.
  - Buildings sequence with adjusted cinematic FOV.
  - BioSphere view transition with fog fade.
  - Upon completion, level switches to Mission 1 with functional ThirdPersonCharacter_NUI.
- Key and Boat Interaction:
  - Implemented key pickup (E to interact).
  - Boat boarding mechanic triggers fog-heavy cinematic to BioSphere.
- Final Death Logic:
  - Integrated ragdoll death with return-to-main-menu functionality.
  - Ensured consistent input restoration on level reload.

# Issues Encountered
- Minor frame hitches when loading Mission 1 from StJaque2, likely due to level streaming overhead.
- Niagara fog opacity in Sequencer required parameter refresh after level load.

# Next Steps
- Optimize level loading for smoother transitions.
- Begin polishing Mission 1 gameplay elements (interaction prompts and cinematic pacing).
