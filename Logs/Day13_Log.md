## Day 13 Log – July 9, 2025

# Tasks Completed
- Finalized the placeholder Level Sequence for the Memory Scene:
  - Triggered after the player "wins" the Key-to-Note mechanic.
  - Implemented smooth camera transition from player view to sequence camera using Set View Target with Blend followed by Play.
- Created seamless exit from the Memory Scene:
  - At the end of the sequence, camera transitions back to the player's view.
  - Character is moved to a new location matching the end position of the cinematic.
  - Used Get Player Character + Cast to ThirdPersonCharacter in the Level Blueprint to relocate the character.
- Verified overall flow: player types correctly → triggers cinematic → ends with player at a new location, ready for next gameplay section.

# Issues Encountered
- Couldn't directly add the spawned ThirdPersonCharacter to the sequencer (since it doesn't exist at design time).
- Solved by using Level Blueprint to move the character at the right moment.
- Minor confusion around order of camera transition and sequence play—resolved by triggering Set View Target with Blend before playing the sequence.

# Next Steps
- Start designing and prototyping the spaceship control mechanic after the memory scene.
- Replace the memory placeholder cinematic with final visual content.
- Develop fog volume transitions for Earth → space visuals.
- Improve typing mechanic to support all keyboard keys and refine visual/audio feedback.
