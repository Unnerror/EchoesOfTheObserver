## Day 6 Log – June 30, 2025

# Tasks Completed
- Set up initial Level Sequence 1 (opening cinematic) and triggered it on BeginPlay using Create Level Sequence Player.
- Added logic to spawn the ThirdPersonCharacter at PlayerStart, possess it, and hide character mesh before cinematic.
- Implemented camera blend from sequence camera to third-person view using Set View Target with Blend.
- Restored player visibility and re-enabled input after sequence ends with a delay and custom event.
- Created white platform Blueprint (BP_Platform) with BoxTrigger to detect player overlap.
- Triggered Level Sequence 2 (platform ascension) from platform Blueprint if player has key and presses E.
- Player remains on the platform during ascent with correct animation timing.

# Issues Fixed
-Bound sequence completion to a custom event that smoothly transitions to player control without visible glitches.
-Avoided redundant interaction prompts by managing widget visibility states and overlap triggers carefully.

# Next Steps
- Add subtle camera shake or particle effects during the platform ascent (Level Sequence 2).
- Compose the space segment of the level (in the same level or as a streamed sublevel).
- Implement a smooth transition from Sequence 2 into the space segment.
- Create dialogue placeholder assets and place them in the space area.
- Add trigger volumes to launch dialogues at specific story points.
- Place a trigger box in the space level for KeyToNote functionality.
- Begin integration of KeyToNote system:
  - Connect transition logic from 3rd person to musical input mode.
  - Animate key press feedback and link sounds via MetaSounds.
- Playtest the pacing of prompts and cinematic transitions, adjusting fade durations and delays for better flow and clarity.
