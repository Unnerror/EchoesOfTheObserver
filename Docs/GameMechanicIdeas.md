# Game Mechanic Ideas – Echoes of the Observer

## Typing Mechanic
- Player types a specific word (“RUN”, “LOVE”, “JOY”, etc.)
- Each letter plays a unique tone
- When typed in correct order: forms a melody
- Wrong letters play dissonant sounds
- Typing may need to speed up over time (in rhythm with background)

## Variations
- Find the correct word first (e.g., from environmental clues)
- Use metaphoric words (“TRUTH”, “SPEAK”, etc.)
- Typing could shape environment visually (post-process, VFX)

## Other Mechanics
- Running section with a visible timer
- Limited directional input to “guide” a character during sequences
